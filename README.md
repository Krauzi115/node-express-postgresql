# This Application is using node, express, knex and handlebars to dynamically display data from our database!


Can you convert your SQL queries from yesterday to work within JS?
Please translate the SQL queries that you wrote during your last requirement into knex queries.

Please render one query per page, i.e,
    -- A list of the top 5 countries by number of invoices
    should have its own path in the index.js file and it's own template(.hbs file).



run `npm install` then `npm start` to get started!

Here's the knex website to help:  http://knexjs.org/
And the handlebars website for templating:  https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#path-expressions
